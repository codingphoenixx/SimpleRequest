/**
 * Annotation to apply multiple {@link CustomRateLimit} configurations to a single method.
 *
 * This annotation acts as a container for defining multiple rate-limiting rules that
 * can be applied to a single method or endpoint. It enables combining multiple instances
 * of the {@link CustomRateLimit} annotation for scenarios requiring more complex
 * or granular rate-limiting configurations. Each {@link CustomRateLimit} specifies its own
 * key, request limit, time window, and optional rate-limiting algorithm.
 *
 * Usage of this annotation allows developers to enforce different rate-limiting policies
 * on the same method, which can be useful for managing requests coming from different
 * users, roles, or client applications.
 *
 * The rate-limiting logic should process all {@link CustomRateLimit} configurations
 * specified within this annotation, applying each set of restrictions independently.
 *
 * This annotation is retained at runtime and can be applied to method declarations only.
 *
 * @see CustomRateLimit
